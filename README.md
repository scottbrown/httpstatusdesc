# httpstatusdesc

A very simple module that maps HTTP status codes from their text
descriptions.  The HTTP status descriptions are taken straight
from [RFC 9110](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#overview.of.status.codes).

This was mainly created because some systems want
you to return both a status code and description, and I don't
want to recreate the wheel each time.
